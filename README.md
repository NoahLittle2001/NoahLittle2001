## Hi, I’m Noah Little. I'm a student at Southeast Missouri State University and I'm majoring in computer science.
### My interest:
- Game Design

- Web Design

### Current Projects
- Currently learning to use React to create my first MERN stack project.

### Possible Future Projects
Combine the MERN stack with an Machine Learning to upload images of cats and dogs. The application will the tell the user if the image is a cat or dog.
